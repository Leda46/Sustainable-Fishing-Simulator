# Sustainable Fishing Simulator
The **Sustainable Fishing Simulator** is a web-based game where players manage a fishing company while having to balance profit and eco-friendliness. This project emphasizes sustainable practices and challenges players to think critically about environmental conservation while having fun.

## Features
- **Timed Challenges**: Special challenges require players to meet specific goals, such as earning a set amount of money within a time limit.
- **Upgrade System**: Players can purchase upgrades to improve their fishing efficiency and contribute to sustainability (e.g., better fishing rods or eco-friendly equipment).
- **Seasonal Changes**: Seasons affect the availability and behavior of fish, creating dynamic gameplay. A seasonal icon will always be displayed in the top right corner and the current season will also be shown along company stats.
- **Eco-Friendly Mechanics**: Overfishing will decrease their sustainability score and may result in penalties. After every day the ecosystem will recover somewhat depending on what sort of equipment the player has.
- **Random Events**: Every once in a while a random event will trigger, such as a sustainability issue or perfect weather for a while. These events can have positive or negative effects on the player's catch.

## How to Play
1. **Start Fishing**: Click on one of the zones to fish. The number of fish will decrease and fish caught today will increase. The colour of the zone will change if there are very few fish left.
2. **Sell Your Catch**: Earn money by selling your catch. To sell your catch you need to end the day and all the fish you caught that day will automatically be sold.
3. **Complete Challenges**: Take on special timed challenges to test your skills and earn extra rewards.
4. **Upgrade**: Use your earnings to buy better equipment or tools that improve your fishing and help maintain the ecosystem.
5. **Progress Through Seasons**: Adapt your strategies to seasonal changes and keep your fishing company thriving.
